## Build

Go to the root of the entire project and run
`npm run build-style-dictionary`

## Custom theme

To use a custom theme you have to create a file called `custom_theme.json`. When building the results end up in /build/. The variables stored in `custom_theme.json` will be used instead of the variables in `default_theme.json` when building the variables to js and sass if both files are present.
