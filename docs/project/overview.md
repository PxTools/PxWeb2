# Project overview
## Background
The user interface in the statistics bank, PX-web, can no longer be further developed effectively due to technological limitations, while the users' needs and expectations are constantly changing. Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway will therefore together create a new user interface based on PxWebAPI 2.0

## New user interface for PxWeb
- New PxWebAPI 2.0 will soon be ready 
- Give us the opportunity to make a new user interface for PxWeb on a new technical platform
- Cooperation between Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway

## Two project goals
- The project will work on a new user interface based on PxWebAPI 2.0 during 2024 with the launch of the first version/beta version in mid-2024

- The project will test and establish good and sustained collaboration processes between SCB and SSB at both operational level and management level in the further development of PX-tools
