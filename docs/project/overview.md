# Project overview
## Background
The user interface in PxWeb can no longer be further developed effectively due to technological limitations, while the users needs and expectations are constantly changing. Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway will therefore together create a new user interface based on PxWebAPI 2.0

## New user interface for PxWeb
- PxWebAPI 2.0 Beta was released i March 
- The API gives us the opportunity to make a new user interface for PxWeb on a new technical platform
- The project is a cooperation between Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway

## Two project goals
- The project will work on a new user interface based on PxWebAPI 2.0 during 2024 with the launch of the first version/beta version in mid-2024

- The project will test and establish good and sustained collaboration processes between SCB and SSB at both operational level and management level in the further development of PX-tools
