# Project overview
## Background
The user interface in the statistics bank, PX-web, can no longer be further developed effectively due to technological limitations, while the users' needs and expectations are constantly changing. Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway will therefore together create a new user interface based on PxWebAPI 2.0

## New user interface for PxWeb
- New PxWebAPI 2.0 will soon be ready 
- Give us the opportunity to make a new user interface for PxWeb on a new technical platform
- Cooperation between Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway
