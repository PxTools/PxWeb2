This repository contains JMeter test plans for performance testing of the PXWEB API, specifically for Tabell 08799.

🧰 Requirements
Apache JMeter 5.4.1

Please ensure JMeter 5.4.1 is installed before running any test plans, as compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.

📂 Test Plans
Once JMeter is installed, you can open and run the following test plans (.jmx) depending on the version of the PX API you want to test:

**Ytelsestest av V1.0 PXWEB Tabell 08799.jmx**

Corresponds to version 1.0 of the PX API

**Ytelsestest av V2.0 PXWEB Tabell 08799.jmx**

Corresponds to version 2.0 of the PX API

🚀 How to Use
Download and extract JMeter 5.4.1.

Start JMeter using the jmeter executable.

Open the desired .jmx test plan file from this repository.

Configure endpoints or parameters if necessary.

Run the test and analyze results in the listeners provided (e.g., Summary Report, View Results Tree).

📌 Notes
These test plans are intended for internal testing purposes.

If you need to adapt the test plans to other tables or endpoints, duplicate and modify accordingly.

Test data and expected responses are based on current structure and may require updates if the API evolves.
