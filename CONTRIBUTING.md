## 3rd Party Components

While developing for this project, we aim to minimize the number of dependencies. This is to keep the project lightweight, maintainable, and to reduce potential security risks. 

Before adding a new 3rd party component or library, please consider the following:

1. Is the component necessary? Can the functionality be achieved without it?
2. Is the component actively maintained? An unmaintained component can pose a security risk and may lack support.
3. Does the component have a large community? Larger communities often mean more resources for troubleshooting and learning.
4. Is the component's license compatible with our project?

If you believe a 3rd party component is necessary, please provide a justification in your pull request. The project maintainers will review and discuss the addition.

## Code Review

All pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Please be patient and responsive during the review process. Feedback and suggestions may be provided to help improve the quality of your contribution.
